1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,188
You're not lazy.

2
00:00:01,188 --> 00:00:02,880
Your brain just hates starting.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,294
The hardest part of any task isn't

4
00:00:05,294 --> 00:00:06,087
doing it.

5
00:00:06,087 --> 00:00:06,880
It's starting.

6
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,294
Your brain sees the whole mountain and

7
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:09,432
freezes.

8
00:00:09,432 --> 00:00:11,713
Here's the fix: The Two Minute Rule.

9
00:00:11,713 --> 00:00:13,903
If something takes less than two minutes,

10
00:00:13,903 --> 00:00:14,914
do it now.

11
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,088
If it's bigger, just commit to two

12
00:00:17,088 --> 00:00:17,088
minutes.

13
00:00:17,088 --> 00:00:19,414
Two minutes is all it takes to

14
00:00:19,414 --> 00:00:20,178
beat resistance.

15
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:20,943
Start small.

16
00:00:20,943 --> 00:00:21,408
Start now.
